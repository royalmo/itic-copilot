## What is it?

I'm studying an ICT Systems Engineering degree (called also iTIC). During the degree I've found that some tools that we needed to use were a little bit hard to understand at first, or they weren't just as productive as they could be.

That's why I created a browser extension that could, at least, try to make the navigation experience better. It is available on all the browsers that let users publish their extensions without having to be rich.

### Extension's public description

If you are an ICT Systems Student at EPSEM, the iTIC Copilot browser extension is a "must have".

Through experience we know the sites that you will spending time on for hours, and we have no doubt that you will be pleased with the following features that we have developed.

- Anti-downloader & full-downloader (OCW's website).
- Atenea & Escriny autologin.
- Grades Calculator (Atenea's website).
- Combination of Escriny's & Overleaf's website.
- Documents with advice (wish we had this when we were studying...).

Boost your productivity with iTIC Copilot, instead of getting getting inside an `ATOMIC_BLOCK`! (you will get the joke by the end of 2nd grade)

## Features

This extension makes the browsing experience of iTIC students much, much easier.

### Better navigation in the OpenCourseWare

- We have added a customizable landing page, so you can access your favourite subjects easily.
- It disables the 'forced download' when accessing some files. Specially, the PDF's, that with the extension are opened with the browser.
- It has a 'download subject' option, that creates a `.zip` file with all the resources of a subject, to make massive downloads easier.
- The same occurs when downloading a folder inside a subject, or when downloading an entire quatrimester.
- We made the download process fully controllable by the end-user (cancel button, messages of errors, etc.).

### Escriny (iTIC's OpenProject) productivity

- We have created a Subversion web client. This means that you can edit, create, and delete files and folders from Escriny's website! Isn't that a dream?
- We have also added a custom landing page, with your private projects (those are the ones that you will usually work on).

### Atenea (iTIC's Moodle) productivity

Work in progress. For the moment, there's nothing here.

### Subject saver

You can save your subjects and groups. This will make some features available:

- You can see your updated timetable with a single click (you don't have to select the groups each time).
- You can easily access your subject's course guides, with a small menu we created.
- The OpenCourseWare's landing page has a more precise information.

## Usage

The extension has a nice User Interface, in witch settings can be changed, and the main websites visited through the degree are available.
Just open it and check every link!

## Manual instalation

By downloading the source code you can use the extension and play with it. As long as you respect the extension's liscence, you can do what you want.

Here you have a tutorial for the manual instalation in Google Chrome. For the other browsers, it should be more or less the same instructions.

### 1. Clone the repository

Assuming you have git installed, run
```
git clone https://github.com/royalmo/itic-copilot.git
```

Otherwise, you can [download the zip file](https://github.com/royalmo/itic-copilot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of the repository, and unzip the downloaded file.

### 2. Activate Chrome developer mode

Go to [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions/) on your Chrome browser and enable **Developer mode** at the top right of the page.

![Developer mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49844173/158700807-1788513c-1581-482d-b9db-b12c30bb7774.png)

### 3. Load the extension folder

A **Load unpacked** button will appear at the top left of the page after enabling *Developer mode*. Click there, and select the *itic-copilot* folder you just cloned.

That's it! You should be able to open OCW's files without downloading them. **Caution!** Make sure you don't delete the downloaded folder! Chrome loads the extension from there every time you open the browser.
